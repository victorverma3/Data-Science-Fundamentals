Flipping a coin is both independent and identically distributed, with the probability of an outcome of heads or tails equal to 0.5. 
In this scenario, the probability of 10 straight heads would then be (0.5)^10, which is 1/1048 or about 0.1%. 
Based on this probability, I would already start to doubt the fairness of the coin by the time I've gotten 10 straight heads.
I would personally start to doubt the fairness of the coin once I got 7 straight heads, which would have about a 0.8% chance of occurring.
