    "There are a couple of reasons. Firstly, a friend of a friend recommended this class to me, saying that it was good. Secondly, I wanted to gain further project experience, because it is both something that I enjoy, and it is something that I feel that the BU curriculum lacks. I'm particularly excited that the project is real-world through BU spark. Lastly, I am a data science minor, and after taking DS340 Introduction to Machine Learning and AI, I felt that this course could add value and reinforce some of those concepts, while helping me get better and learn new things."

    "Yes. I took DS340, which is Introduction to Machine Learning and AI. We learned some of the theory/implementation for look-ahead based methods, monte-carlo tree search, naive bayes, decision trees/random forests, neural networks. Also briefly touched upon GANs, stable diffusion, attention, and transformer architecture. For my final project I implemented a LSTM and RNN to predict NFL statistics for QBs, RBs, WRs, and TEs. I also do some research for a professor in Questrom where I have utilized random forests, k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, and neural networks (mostly off the shelf from scikit-learn and tensorflow) to assess the accuracy of our output dataset."
